                   Loves to do anything new, curious about something new, motivates about something new 
                  anything new is interesting. I think I want to learn anything in tech and practice coding because I need to.
                            I can't sing nor dance I love cooking fried egg because I can,  I love playing games but I don't want because time cannot stop me. I also spend some time reading but I prefer to watch it. 
                            I want to explore world and dive into something. I believe in the power of something maybe it's something wonderful. When I'm not [Working/Practicing], you'll find me [Hobbies/Activities], exploring around anything. I hope you learn something about me feel free to get connected, I'll put the contacts below 
                            Feel free to say HI! </p>
